#+TITLE: =jasp=

This is a python module for running VASP our way. See http://jkitchin.github.io/dft for comprehensive examples of using =jasp=.

* Installation
First clone the repository, and make sure the =jasp= directory in the repository is on your PYTHONPATH. [fn:1]

You need to have the following environment variables set:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
VASP_PP_PATH
VASP_SCRIPT

Mine are set too:
16:12:37 1114> echo $VASP_PP_PATH 
/home-research/jkitchin/src/vasp/
16:12:41 1115> echo $VASP_SCRIPT 
/home-research/jkitchin/kitchin-python/jasp/bin/runjasp.py
#+END_EXAMPLE 

You may also want to add jasp/bin to your PATH.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout dev
#+END_SRC

[fn:1] you could run python setup.py install, but it is not necessary.
